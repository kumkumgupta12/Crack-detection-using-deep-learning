# damage_detection_using_deep_learning

UNET Architecture has shown its robustness in medical image segmentation, as similar Surface Cracks are small hairlined which could be detected by segmentation task.  




To improve more than Just UNET , Many models have implemented to test and see the trends which includes :  

ResNet50 pretrained Model in PYtorch.  
REsNet101  (more denser than Resnet50)  
UNET


 UNET+ASPP+INCEPTION module showed the Roubstness to Tokaido Dataset(japanese railway viaducts)   
Results - mean IOU - 0.31


 *****Further Improvment is done *****:

 ##UNEt3++ Architecture is implemented (which is more denser and has different architecture wrt skip Connections)  
 #Results: mean IOU - 0.47 (showed Succesive Improvements)
